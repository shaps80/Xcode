Xcode-Templates
===============

These Xcode templates are based on the defaults that come pre-built however they have better copyright info.
I also plan on expanding on these over time to include common functionality and also include additional boilerplate classes that work alongside my own library.

I also have plans to add additional templates such as a Singleton, etc...
